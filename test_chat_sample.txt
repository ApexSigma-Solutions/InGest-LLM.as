Sample Chat Thread for Testing

User: Hello, I'm setting up Docker containers for ApexSigma
Assistant: I'll help you set up the Docker containers. Let's start with the network configuration.

User: I'm having network issues between containers
Assistant: Let's check the apexsigma_net network configuration. Are all containers on the same network?

User: Yes, but InGest-LLM.as can't reach memOS.as
Assistant: Let me test the connectivity between containers.

SUCCESS: Network integration working after fixing docker-compose.yml
✅ All containers now communicating properly
❌ Some minor issues with Unicode display

User: Can you create a progress log?
Assistant: I'll save this progress to memOS.as for historical tracking.

Integration test completed successfully with full container communication.
