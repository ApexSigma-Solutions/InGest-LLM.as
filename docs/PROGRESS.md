# Progress Log

Date: 2025-08-24

Changes
- Model tweak: Updated tier mapping in `src/ingest_llm_as/models.py` so MemoryStorageResponse maps tier `2` to `PROCEDURAL` (aligns with current memOS/InGest routing where code and procedural content are stored in tier 2).

Why
- Ensure user-facing responses and internal enums reflect the actual storage tier semantics. This also aligns tests that assert `procedural` for tier 2.

Impact
- No API surface change; only the enum resolution for display/response changed. Existing ingestion flows remain the same.

Verification Results
- ✅ All integration tests passing (16/16) - no UUID serialization errors
- ✅ Code content (content_type: "code") → memory_tier: "procedural" (tier 2)  
- ✅ Text content (content_type: "text") → memory_tier: "semantic" (tier 3)
- ✅ Concurrent ingestion working correctly
- ✅ Memory IDs returned successfully in all cases

Tests Run
- `test_ingestion_e2e.py`: 11 tests passed (health, basic/async text, code content, memory verification/search, error handling, concurrent ingestion)
- `test_memos_integration_core.py`: 5 tests passed (text ingestion, code procedural memory, search integration, concurrent, error handling)

Next Steps  
- Optionally clean up style lints in `models.py` (switch to built-in typing, add trailing commas to Field calls) in a separate pass.
- Consider addressing pytest deprecation warnings for async fixtures in future cleanup.

Notes
- Codacy CLI analysis should be run for the modified file once the Codacy MCP server tools are available in this environment.
