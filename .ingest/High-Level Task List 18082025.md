# High-Level Task List for This Evening's Session

A prioritized list of tasks across the ecosystem. The focus is on unblocking critical integration work first, then tackling high-priority development goals.

---

## Priority 1: [Ecosystem-Wide] Stabilize the Docker Network

*Goal: Resolve the root-cause networking issues to enable reliable integration testing.*

- [x] **Implement Unified Network:** Define and apply the `apexsigma_net` custom bridge network in the primary `docker-compose.yml` file.
- [x] **Assign All Services:** Ensure all 13 services are attached to the `apexsigma_net`.
- [ ] **Verify Communication:** Confirm that services can communicate using their service names as hostnames (e.g., `postgres-memos`, `rabbitmq`).
- [ ] **Test End-to-End Flow:** Run the `InGest-LLM.as CLI` tests to validate successful communication with the `memOS.as` service.

---

## Priority 2: [InGest-LLM.as] Prototype POML-based Context Generator

*Goal: Automate the creation of agent context bullets using a dynamic, template-driven system.*

- [x] **Install POML SDK:** Add the `poml` Python library to the project's dependencies.
- [x] **Create Prompt Component Library:** Initialize the `/prompts` directory and create initial `.poml` component files (e.g., `mission_brief.poml`, `project_status.poml`).
- [x] **Develop Generator Script:** Build a Python script to read data from the Master Knowledge Graph and use the POML templates to render a final, up-to-date context bullet.

---

## Priority 3: [memOS.as] Begin Graph API Development

*Goal: Start exposing the Neo4j knowledge graph capabilities.*

- [x] **Scaffold API Endpoints:** Create the initial FastAPI routes for basic graph queries.
- [x] **Implement Neo4j Driver:** Connect the new endpoints to the Neo4j driver.
- [x] **Create Test Endpoint:** Establish a functional `/graph` endpoint that can execute a simple, hardcoded Cypher query.

---

## Priority 4: [InGest-LLM.as] Implement Caching Foundation

*Goal: Set up the core components for efficient and cost-effective prompt management.*

- [x] **Configure Redis Cache:** Set up the Redis service as the LLM Cache to store and retrieve prompt-response pairs.

---

## Priority 5: [Ecosystem-Wide] Implement Documentation Automation

*Goal: Automate the process of building and updating project documentation.*

- [x] **Implement Build Script:** Set up and run the `build_docs.py` script.
- [x] **Generate Initial Docs:** Run the script to generate the first set of automated documentation for at least one of the projects.
