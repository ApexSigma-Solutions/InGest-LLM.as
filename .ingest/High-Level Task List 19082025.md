# High-Level Task List for This Evening's Session

Here is the prioritized plan for tonight. The focus is on resolving all critical infrastructure and observability blockers before moving on to validation and feature development.

---

## Priority 1: [Critical Blocker] Finalize Observability Instrumentation

*Goal: Ensure LLM traces from `InGest-LLM.as` are correctly captured and visible in the Langfuse dashboard.*

- [ ] **Verify Langfuse Configuration:** Check that `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, and `LANGFUSE_HOST` environment variables are correctly set and passed to the `InGest-LLM.as` container.
- [ ] **Review Code Instrumentation:** Inspect the key functions in `InGest-LLM.as` that make LLM calls and confirm the `@observe()` decorator is correctly implemented.
- [ ] **Test Connectivity:** Run a simple test from within the `InGest-LLM.as` container to ensure it can connect to the Langfuse service endpoint.
- [ ] **Trigger and Verify Trace:** Manually trigger an action that involves an LLM call (like a test ingestion) and immediately check the Langfuse dashboard to confirm the trace appears.

## Priority 2: [Critical Blocker] Resolve DevEnviro.as API Failure

*Goal: Achieve a 12/12 container-up status for the `DevEnviro.as` environment, making the entire ecosystem fully operational.*

- [ ] **Add Dependency:** In the `DevEnviro.as` project, add `psycopg2-binary = "^2.9.9"` to the `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` section of its `pyproject.toml` file.
- [ ] **Rebuild Image:** From the `DevEnviro.as` root directory, run `docker-compose build devenviro-api` to create a new image with the required library.
- [ ] **Relaunch & Verify:** Run `docker-compose up -d` and confirm that all services start successfully and remain in a healthy state.

---

## Priority 3: [Validation] Conduct Full End-to-End Integration Test

*Goal: Formally validate that the core data pipeline is functioning correctly across the newly stabilized Docker network.*

- [ ] **Execute Test:** Run the integration test that sends sample data from the `InGest-LLM.as` service.
- [ ] **Confirm Storage:** Verify that the test data is successfully received, processed, and stored in the correct memory tier within `memOS.as`. This confirms the entire infrastructure is sound.

---

## Priority 4: [Development] Begin High-Priority Feature Implementation

*Goal: Pivot from infrastructure work to building the core intelligent features of the ecosystem.*

- [ ] **`memOS.as` - Graph API:** Begin the implementation of the three specified Graph API endpoints: `/graph/related`, `/graph/shortest-path`, and `/graph/subgraph`.
- [ ] **`InGest-LLM.as` - POML Prototype:** Begin the implementation of the POML-based context generator by installing the SDK and creating the initial prompt component library in the `/prompts` directory.
