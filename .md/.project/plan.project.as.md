# Development Plan: InGest-LLM.as

**Version:** 1.3

This document outlines the strategic milestones for the development of the InGest-LLM.as microservice. The primary goal is to establish a robust, automated data ingestion pipeline that operates asynchronously and reliably within the DevEnviro ecosystem.

---

## Milestone 1: Foundational Service & HTTP Pipeline (COMPLETE)

*This milestone focused on building the core microservice architecture, establishing a direct, synchronous ingestion endpoint, and instrumenting a comprehensive observability stack.*

---

## Milestone 2: Integration, Embedding & Advanced Ingestion (COMPLETE)

*This milestone focused on validating the existing pipeline, integrating with the local LM Studio for embedding, and expanding the service's ingestion capabilities to handle more complex data sources.*

---

## Milestone 3: Prompt Modernization & Automation (NEW)

***This new milestone focuses on evolving from static prompt definitions to a dynamic, scalable, and maintainable prompt generation system using modern tooling.***

### Objective 5: Implement POML-based Dynamic Context Generation.

**Goal:** To replace static context definitions with a dynamic, template-driven system using POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language). This will ensure agents always receive real-time, relevant, and efficiently structured information generated directly from the Master Knowledge Graph.
