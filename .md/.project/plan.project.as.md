# Development Plan: InGest-LLM.as

**Version:** 1.2

This document outlines the strategic milestones for the development of the InGest-LLM.as microservice. The primary goal is to establish a robust, automated data ingestion pipeline that operates asynchronously and reliably within the DevEnviro ecosystem.

---

## Milestone 1: Foundational Service & HTTP Pipeline (COMPLETE)

This milestone focused on building the core microservice architecture, establishing a direct, synchronous ingestion endpoint, and instrumenting a comprehensive observability stack.

### Objective 1: Service Foundation & Integration. (COMPLETE)
- **Outcome:** The service structure was created and integrated into the Docker Compose environment with proper configuration and logging.

### Objective 2: Develop Initial Parsing Capability. (COMPLETE)
- **Outcome:** A modular system for reading, chunking, and extracting metadata from plain text was implemented.

### Objective 3: Establish Direct `memOS.as` Integration. (COMPLETE)
- **Outcome:** A robust HTTP client was built to communicate directly with memOS.as, routing ingested content to the correct memory tiers.

### Objective 4: Implement Production-Ready Observability. (COMPLETE)
- **Outcome:** The service was fully instrumented with Prometheus, Jaeger, Loki, and Langfuse for complete system and LLM telemetry.

## Milestone 2: Integration, Embedding & Advanced Ingestion

This milestone focuses on validating the existing pipeline, integrating with the local LM Studio for embedding, and expanding the service's ingestion capabilities to handle more complex data sources.

### Objective 1: Validate End-to-End Service Integration.
- **Goal:** To conduct a full integration test between InGest-LLM.as and memOS.as to verify the entire data flow and configure inter-service networking.

### Objective 2: Integrate Local Embedding Service.
- **Goal:** To replace placeholder embedding logic with a live connection to a local model served via LM Studio, enabling fully private and customized vectorization.

### Objective 3: Implement Specialized Code Parser.
- **Goal:** To develop a sophisticated parser for Python codebases using the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to extract meaningful, context-aware chunks.

### Objective 4: Expand Ingestion Endpoints.
- **Goal:** To broaden the service's utility by adding new endpoints capable of ingesting entire code repositories and content from public URLs.
