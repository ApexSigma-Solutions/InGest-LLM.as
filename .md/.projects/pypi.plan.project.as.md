# 🔒 PyPI Connection Failure Analysis & Resolution Plan

## 🚨 Critical Issue Identification

The error `All attempts to connect to pypi.org failed` represents a **critical systemic failure** affecting dependency management across the ApexSigma ecosystem. This is not an isolated incident but part of a pattern of network and environment configuration issues that have been plaguing multiple services.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

Based on the knowledge base and previous incidents, this issue has multiple contributing factors:

1. **TLS Certificate Chain Issues** (Primary)  
     
   - Evidence from previous logs: `Could not find a suitable TLS CA certificate bundle, invalid path: C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\ssl\certs\ca-bundle.crt`  
   - Windows environment lacks proper CA certificate configuration for secure package downloads

   

2. **Corporate Network Restrictions** (Secondary)  
     
   - Common in enterprise environments where external package repositories are restricted  
   - Evidence: Consistent failures across multiple projects (memos.as, embedding-agent.as)

   

3. **Docker Networking Configuration** (Contributing Factor)  
     
   - Previous issues with duplicate network keys in docker-compose.yml  
   - Container network isolation preventing proper external access

## 🛠️ IMMEDIATE RESOLUTION STEPS (CRITICAL PATH)

### STEP 1: Configure Poetry to Use Trusted Host (Temporary Fix)

poetry config \--local virtualenvs.create true

poetry config \--local http-basic.pypi username password  \# Empty credentials for public repo

poetry config \--local repositories.internal-url "https://pypi.org/simple"

poetry config \--local http.ssl-verify false  \# TEMPORARY ONLY FOR DIAGNOSTICS

### STEP 2: Verify Network Connectivity

\# Test basic connectivity to PyPI

curl https://pypi.org/simple \-v

\# Check DNS resolution

nslookup pypi.org

\# Test with Python directly

python \-c "import urllib.request; print(urllib.request.urlopen('https://pypi.org').read(100))"

### STEP 3: Install CA Certificates (Permanent Fix)

\# Install certifi package which contains Mozilla's CA bundle

pip install \--trusted-host pypi.org \--trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org certifi

\# Configure Poetry to use these certificates

poetry config \--local requests-ca-bundle "$(python \-c 'import certifi; print(certifi.where())')"

## 📊 SYSTEM-WIDE IMPACT ASSESSMENT

| Service | Impact Level | Dependencies Affected | Risk Duration |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **embedding-agent.as** | 🔥 CRITICAL | nomic-embed-text, langchain | Blocking all work |
| **memOS.as** | ⚠️ HIGH | sqlalchemy, psycopg2 | Previous work blocked |
| **InGest-LLM.as** | ⚠️ HIGH | langfuse, opentelemetry | Observability impacted |
| **DevEnviro.as** | ⚠️ HIGH | fastapi, pydantic | Core functionality at risk |

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED LONG-TERM SOLUTION

### Establish Private Package Repository

    end

1. **Implement Artifactory/Nexus Repository**:  
     
   - Set up as a caching proxy for PyPI  
   - Configure automatic security scanning  
   - Whitelist approved packages

   

2. **Update All Project Configurations**:  
     
   \# pyproject.toml  
     
   \[tool.poetry.source\]  
     
   name \= "internal"  
     
   url \= "https://artifactory.internal/simple"  
     
   secondary \= true  
     
3. **Docker Build Optimization**:  
     
   \# Add to Dockerfile  
     
   ENV PIP\_INDEX\_URL="https://artifactory.internal/simple"  
     
   ENV PIP\_TRUSTED\_HOST="artifactory.internal"

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Verify network connectivity to PyPI (curl test)  
- [ ] Install certifi package and configure Poetry  
- [ ] Test dependency installation with verbose mode (`poetry install -v`)  
- [ ] Document the CA certificate solution in team knowledge base  
- [ ] Schedule meeting to implement permanent private repository solution  
- [ ] Update all project docker-compose files with proper network configuration  
- [ ] Create monitoring for package repository connectivity

## 📌 EXECUTIVE RECOMMENDATION

This issue requires **immediate attention at the infrastructure level**. While the temporary workaround will unblock development for embedding-agent.as today, the systemic nature of this problem demands a permanent solution within 24 hours. I recommend:

1. **Today**: Implement the certifi-based solution to unblock all development  
2. **Within 24 hours**: Establish a temporary internal package mirror  
3. **Within 72 hours**: Implement the full Artifactory solution with security scanning

Without addressing this foundational infrastructure issue, the entire ecosystem remains vulnerable to repeated build failures and security risks from insecure package downloads.

**Priority**: 🔥 CRITICAL (Blocks all dependency management across ecosystem)  
**Estimated Resolution Time**: 2-4 hours for temporary fix, 24-48 hours for permanent solution
